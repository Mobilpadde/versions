# Versions

### A tool to generate a simple timelapse for a front-end in a repo (git repository)

## Why

I always think it's fun to look at the progess of any project I make. Sadly, it's a bore to checkout every version committed to git, thus, this tool has come to life! ðŸ¤“

## What

Explained in simple words: It makes a version-lapse (timelapse) of a repo.

Please checkout the gif below to see what I mean by this.

## How

It's quite simple to use. I promise! Download the source-code of this repo. Fire up a terminal and type in `go run . -path ../path/to/git/repo -commits 5 -wait 5`, this will make a version-lapse of of the last `5 commits` of the repo `../path/to/git/repo`. It starts a dev server, waits `5 seconds`, takes a screendump and annotates it. Lastly it makes the `5 commits` into a gif. Easy peasy!

## Usage

First, make sure you have `ImageMagick <= 7.x` installed.

Second, have a `Chromium`-browser installed.

Third, and most importantly, have `go >= 1.11` installed - As I'm not yet providing native builds of this program.

Then we have some flags to configure.

Required:

 * `-path` - specifies the path to the repo you'd like to make a verison-lapse of.

Useful:

 * `-commits`
   * defaults to `0`, meaning all the commits. 

 * `-port`
   * defaults to `5000`, and will use ports from `5000` to `5000 + N_COMMITS`.

 * `-wait`
   * defaults to `5`, this will let the program wait for `5` seconds to start the app, `5` seconds to load the page and (always) `1` second to process the screendump.
   * This adds up to `5 + 5 + 1 = 11` seconds for each commit to process.

## Post Scriptum

If the program cashes at any point, you'd `git checkout master` on the repo specified. The program **will** try to clean up after itself, but might fail at times.

If you by any reason decide to run the program again on the same repo or any other repo, it'll clean the `screendumps`-dir and `out.gif`-file. So make sure to save whatever you need!
